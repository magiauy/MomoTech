## About
This is Slimefun addon for minecraft servers.

It includes many special machines and items to make you play more enjoyable!

(For example, something could generate different kinds of stones/fishes/... even command blocks! Or something could affect you saturation in minecraft, there's more things are waiting for you to explore!)

This project is still processing (Maybe it will update after 2024.6, because I need to prepare an exam).

The author is only an amateur code enthusiast, maybe there's something not fine, anyway if you give me suggestions, I'll try my best to get it.

Welcome to feedback bugs and give suggestions and supports,

The project now uses 1.20.1 API of minecraft, and RC-35 of Slimefun4

and only have Chinese versions now, but maybe we'll have English versions later, also, welcome you to help me translate it!

# You'd better use the latest version because maybe there's some bugs in the old versions :D
